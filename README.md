I spoke with a financial advisor concerning his desire to teach kids about the stock market. One aspect of his curriculum was to incorporate a game in which students would have to identify a company's stock symbol when given the company name. Being an educator and stock market enthusiast, I passionately developed this application to assist with his educational program. The application allows for users to login, complete a multiple-choice quiz, and have their score recorded in a database. This would allow for the instructor to keep track of the scores from each of his students.
